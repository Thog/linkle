# sprinkle

## Introduction

*sprinkle* is an alternate fork of [linkle](https://github.com/MegatonHammer/linkle), extending it for some specific purposes.

It is aimed as a simple build command for projects based on this organization's libraries and tools, to avoid having to mess with makefiles or scripts, and including support for generating various formats (linkle's original purpose) after projects are built.

## Installation

Assuming you have `cargo` installed, `cargo install sprinkle --git https://github.com/aarch64-switch-rs/sprinkle`
will install the `sprinkle` subcommand.

## Project formats

Extra fields used for building are placed inside `[package.metadata.sprinkle.<format>]` in Cargo.toml. These fields vary depending on the project's format:

### NRO

Projects which generate homebrew NRO binaries don't need any mandatory fields/files, but can set optional ones.

- Example:

```toml
[package]
name = "Project"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["XorTroll"]
edition = "2018"

[package.metadata.sprinkle.nro]
romfs = "romfs_dir"
icon = "icon.jpg"
nacp = { name = "Sample project", author = "XorTroll", version = "0.1 beta" }
```

> Note: the `romfs` and `icon` fields must point to items located in the same directory as Cargo.toml!

#### NACP fields

> Note: every fields are optional!

| Field             | Description                                      | Default value       |
| ----------------- |:------------------------------------------------:| -------------------:|
| name              | The application name.                            | Unknown Application |
| author            | The application author.                          | Unknown Author      |
| version           | The application version.                         | 1.0.0               |
| title_id          | The application title id.                        | 0000000000000000    |
| dlc_base_title_id | The base id of all the title DLC.                | title_id + 0x1000   |
| lang (object)     | Different name/author depending of the language  | use name and author |

| Supported Languages|
|:------------------:|
| en-US              |
| en-UK              |
| ja                 |
| fr                 |
| de                 |
| es-419             |
| es                 |
| it                 |
| nl                 |
| fr-CA              |
| pt                 |
| ru                 |
| ko                 |
| zh-TW              |
| zh-CN              |

- Example with specific languages:

```toml
[package]
name = "Multi-language"
version = "0.2.0"
authors = ["XorTroll"]
edition = "2018"

[package.metadata.sprinkle.nro]
nacp = { name = "A", author = "B", version = "0.2 beta", lang = { ja = { name = "J" }, es = { author = "X" }, it = { name = "I", author = "T" } } }

# Result:
# - Japanese: "J", "B"
# - Spanish: "A", "X"
# - Italian: "I", "T"
# - Other languages: "A", "B"
```

> Note: only `name` and `author` can be language-specific, other parameters such as `titleid` or `version` are not!

### NSP

Projects which generate sysmodule NSP exefs packages need a single, mandatory field for the NPDM data:

- Example:

```toml
[package]
name = "Project"
version = "0.2.10"
authors = ["XorTroll"]
edition = "2018"

[package.metadata.sprinkle.nsp]
npdm = "npdm.json"
```

> Note: the NPDM JSON file follows the same format used in most homebrews (check projects like Atmosphere, emuiibo, ldn_mitm...) and must be located in the same directory as Cargo.toml!

## Building

> Command: `sprinkle <format> [<optional-extra-cargo-arguments>]`

> Available formats (listed above): `nro`, `nsp`

Running this command will (among other minor details) run `cargo build` and, after building the project, will generate the specific files depending on the project build format.

A default target is used, whose JSON specs are included within sprinkle itself (check [here](/specs)). Support for custom targets is planned but not supported yet.
